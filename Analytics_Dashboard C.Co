Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance for a cookie company, focusing on profit trends and customer behavior. This project highlights my ability to visualize business data for strategic insights.

Profit analysis by date, country (e.g., Mexico: 203,325 units sold), and product (e.g., Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, Snickerdoodle).

Visuals for sales trends and geographic performance.

Designed for stakeholder decision-making.

Context: Built to strengthen my data analytics portfolio, showcasing Power BI and SQL .
